Etch a Sketch - Odin Projects

This is a pixelated drawing canvas. 
Draw your pain away by using different colors and pixel sizes!
also you could draw NFT pictures from here if you want.
but screenshoot it yourself would you? 

all jokes aside, this is my task for Odin Project "Etch a Sketch".
I put my efforts in here, some of the code maybe refferering to someone else's code but I always tried to understand the logic behind it.
so I put some of mine and mixed it with other's code.
As someone in the internet said "if you copy from one source it is a plagiarism, if you copy it from various source it is a research" :)

Have a good day!
